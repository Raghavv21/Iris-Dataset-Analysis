# Iris-Dataset-Analysis
This repository is dedicated to exploring the Iris dataset, one of the most iconic datasets in the field of machine learning and data analysis. The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the dataset through practical analysis and problem-solving.

# Problem Statement:
The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. This repository explores the following key problems:

1. Count of Flowers: Determining the count of each flower type.
2. Data Analysis on Iris-Virginica: Filtering data for "Iris-virginica" where petal-length > 1.5.
3. Feature Statistics: Calculating minimum, maximum, and average values for features of each flower type.

# Key Features of This Repository:

1. Data Exploration: Understand and visualize the structure of the Iris dataset.
2. Problem-Specific Solutions: Python scripts to solve the outlined problems.
3. Statistical Analysis: Deriving meaningful insights from the dataset using Pandas.
4. Clean and Modular Code: Well-documented and easy-to-understand code structure.

Ideal for beginners and enthusiasts in data analysis and machine learning. Contributions are welcome!
